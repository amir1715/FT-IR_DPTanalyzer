# FT-IR_DPTanalyzer
A frontend app using Java Scripts, JQuery and the JS library amcharts4 for reading and interpretation of vibrational peaks in DPT files as well as production of spectra outputs as png and excel files.
The input DPT formats were based on a Bruker vertex 70 FT-IR spectrometer.
The app was tested on chrome and firefox.
The input file as in the example folder is a comma delimited text file with no heading that include two columns (the first column is the wave number and the second is the transmittance)
